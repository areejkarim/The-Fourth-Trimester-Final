# 🌸 The Fourth Trimester

**A personalized postpartum wellness companion**

The “fourth trimester” is one of the most vulnerable yet least supported phases of maternal care. This application helps new mothers navigate recovery after childbirth by delivering **personalized, evidence-grounded guidance** tailored to their unique postpartum journey.

## 🩺 Problem Statement

Postpartum care is often fragmented, one-size-fits-all, and limited to a single follow-up appointment weeks after birth. New mothers are left to self-manage physical recovery, emotional changes, and daily care decisions with minimal real-time support.

## 💡 Our Solution

**The Fourth Trimester** acts as a daily digital companion that adapts to:
- Birth type (vaginal vs. C-section)
- Days postpartum
- Self-reported symptoms and mood
- Recovery progress

The platform provides clear, reassuring, and practical guidance during the critical weeks after hospital discharge.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Personalized daily recovery guidance**
  - Tailored by birth type and postpartum timeline
  - Adjusts recommendations as recovery progresses

- **Daily action plans & reminders**
  - Gentle recovery tasks
  - Self-care check-ins
  - Symptom monitoring

- **Mood & wellness tracking**
  - Encourages reflection and early identification of concerning trends

- **Nutrient-focused, low-effort recipes**
  - Designed for postpartum recovery
  - Minimal prep for exhausted caregivers

- **Community support**
  - Optional local meetups and shared experiences

## 🤖 AI & Safety-First Design

The app uses **Google Gemini AI** with a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline** to ensure:
- Guidance is grounded in trusted medical sources
- Responses are context-aware and personalized
- Advice remains supportive and non-diagnostic

> ⚠️ This application does not replace professional medical care and encourages users to seek clinical support when concerning symptoms arise.
